# Github Deployment Script

## Description

This is a simple PHP script for Github's post-receive webhook

## Setup & Installation

1. Setup your repository on Github, if you haven't already
2. On the deployment server, get an SSH key for the web user.
	* Assuming this is apache, to find the web user, run: <code>ps aux | egrep "httpd|apache"</code> -- may be apache, _www, www-data. Let's assume it's www-data:

			sudo mkdir /var/www/.ssh/
			sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.ssh/
			sudo -Hu www-data ssh-keygen -t rsa
			[default dir of /var/www/.ssh/ is fine, no password]
			sudo cat /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3. Add the SSH key as a deploy key in Github, https://github.com/your-account/your-repo/settings/keys
4. Clone the deploy script to a web-accessible location, git clone git://github.com/mboynes/github-deploy.git
5. Add a deploy-config.php file and in it define constants to override the defaults:

		# A regex matching the ref of the "push". <code>git pull</code> will only run if this matches. Default is the master branch.
		define( 'REF_REGEX', '#^refs/heads/master$#' );

		# Log location; make sure it exists
		define( 'LOG', '../logs/deploy.log' );

		# Where is your repo directory? This script will chdir to it. If %s is present, it gets replaced with the repository name
		define( 'REPO_DIR', dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/wp-content/themes/%s/" );

		# If set to true, $_POST gets logged
		define( 'DUMP_POSTDATA', false );

		# In your webhook URL to github, you can append ?auth={{ this field }} as a very simple gut-check authentication
		define( 'AUTH_KEY', 'enter-anything-you-want-here' );

		# Where is your git binary, and what command would you like to run?
		define( 'GIT_COMMAND', '/usr/local/bin/git pull' );

		# Do we want to do IP verification?
		define( 'VERIFY_IP', true );


6. Create the log directory and file, and make sure the user running apache (www-data) has write access to it.
7. In your Github repository, add a WebHook URL. Go to Settings/Admin -> Service Hooks -> WebHook URL (https://github.com/your-account/your-repo/settings/hooks). Add in the URL for your deploy.php file, append ?auth=something if you set the AUTH_KEY. For example, http://deploy.example.com/deploy.php?auth=foobar123 - you'll also need to need to set the content-type to application/x-www-urlencoded
8. Clone your repository, if you haven't already. Do so as the web server's user, <code>sudo -Hu www-data git clone git@github.com:your-account/your-repo.git</code>
9. If you go back to the WebHook URL page in Github, you can test your webhook. Check your log, and make sure it's all set!
